    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I’ve been working on a toy that launches an REPL in <code>adb shell</code>, which would be more comfortable to use if it has the line editing functionality similar to <code>bash</code>. After some research, I found that actually there are a number of line editing libraries available, so it should be a nice and easy addition. However, after some integration work, I was surprised to find that all these libraries (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jline/jline3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jline3</a>, <a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">linenoise</a> (which was also once <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/tags/android-4.4.4_r2.0.1/liblinenoise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">imported into AOSP</a>)) only worked on older versions of Android, that is, until Android 8.0.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Identifying-the-issue"><a href="#Identifying-the-issue" class="headerlink" title="Identifying the issue"></a>Identifying the issue</h2><p>So I created a <a href="https://github.com/zhanghai/linenoise-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small sample app</a> with <code>linenoise</code> and debugged it to pinpoint the issue. Strangely, I found that it was <a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise/blob/97d2850af13c339369093b78abe5265845d78220/linenoise.c#L258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the following line</a> that failed:</p><figure class="highlight c"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">/* put terminal in raw mode after flushing */</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (tcsetattr(fd,TCSAFLUSH,&amp;raw) &lt; <span class="number">0</span>) <span class="keyword">goto</span> fatal;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Which returned <code>-1</code> with <code>errno</code> set to <code>EACCES</code> (<code>13</code>). But why would this terminal configuration fail anyway?</p><p>So I took a look at <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/tcsetattr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>man tcsetattr</code></a>:</p><blockquote><p>tcsetattr() sets the parameters associated with the terminal (unless support is required from the underlying hardware that is not available) from the termios structure referred to by termios_p. optional_actions specifies when the changes take effect:</p><p>TCSANOW</p><p>the change occurs immediately.</p><p>TCSADRAIN</p><p>the change occurs after all output written to fd has been transmitted. This function should be used when changing parameters that affect output.</p><p>TCSAFLUSH</p><p>the change occurs after all output written to the object referred by fd has been transmitted, and all input that has been received but not read will be discarded before the change is made.</p></blockquote><p>The manual page didn’t contain any information for specific error codes, so it wasn’t very helpful for understanding why we’ve got <code>EACCES</code>. Maybe we’ve lost some kind of access to the TTY device since Android 8.0+? However, the default Android shell <code>mksh</code> (used by <code>adb shell</code>) still has working line editing, and how that was done became another mystery to me.</p><p>So I began searching for <code>tcsetattr Android</code>, and found that the Termux people also noticed <a href="https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/1359" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the same issue</a> years ago — the <code>EACCES</code> was actually a SELinux denial. And as a workaround, they were redefining <code>TCSAFLUSH</code> to be <code>TCSANOW</code>, but that isn’t functionally equivalent and may be subject to subtle breakages. So I decided to find out what was actually going wrong in SELinux.</p><p>My next step was to figure out why line editing is still working for <code>mksh</code> — is there any similar patch in AOSP, and how did AOSP do it? After some code search, I found out that <code>mksh</code> was actually <a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/mksh/src/sh.h;l=530;drc=a5d35a625a246b18a75388646d6b9b861c6dda4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using <code>TCSADRAIN</code> instead of <code>TCSAFLUSH</code></a> since a long time ago, so it seems both <code>TCSANOW</code> and <code>TCSADRAIN</code> are working, and it’s just <code>TCSAFLUSH</code> became broken on Android 8.0+. However, <code>TCSAFLUSH</code> still sounds more robust and is still <a href="https://cs.android.com/search?q=TCSAFLUSH%20-f:.*%5C.(h%7Cgo%7Cpy%7Crs%7Ctxt)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being used in a number of places in Android</a>, notably <code>toybox</code>‘s <code>stty</code> implementation (which broke <code>jline3</code>). So I think it’s still worth fixing <code>TCSAFLUSH</code>.</p><h2 id="Debugging-the-SELinux-denial"><a href="#Debugging-the-SELinux-denial" class="headerlink" title="Debugging the SELinux denial"></a>Debugging the SELinux denial</h2><p>To debug the SELinux denial, I looked at the SELinux logcat message on an Android 11 emulator:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">type&#x3D;1400 audit(0.0:763): avc: denied &#123; ioctl &#125; for path&#x3D;&quot;&#x2F;dev&#x2F;pts&#x2F;0&quot; dev&#x3D;&quot;devpts&quot; ino&#x3D;3 ioctlcmd&#x3D;0x5404 scontext&#x3D;u:r:shell:s0 tcontext&#x3D;u:object_r:devpts:s0 tclass&#x3D;chr_file permissive&#x3D;0</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It is clear that <code>tcsetattr</code> is actually a wrapper over an <code>ioctl</code> operation on the TTY device, and Android do have SELinux rules over <code>ioctl</code>. So I looked for <code>devpts</code> and <code>ioctl</code> inside <a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/sepolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system/sepolicy</a>, and found the macro <code>unpriv_tty_ioctls</code> in <a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/sepolicy/public/ioctl_macros;l=51;drc=5fe69e082ac44aba637469fc59fee9f311c8d20b" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ioctl_macros</code></a>:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># commonly used TTY ioctls</span><br><span class="line"># merge with unpriv_unix_sock_ioctls?</span><br><span class="line">define(&#96;unpriv_tty_ioctls&#39;, &#96;&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  TIOCOUTQ FIOCLEX FIONCLEX TCGETS TCSETS TIOCGWINSZ TIOCSWINSZ TIOCSCTTY</span><br><span class="line">  TCSETSW TCFLSH TIOCSPGRP TIOCGPGRP</span><br><span class="line">&#125;&#39;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Which is used in <a href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/sepolicy/public/domain.te;l=293;drc=12376168b44904799936cad2ea1de10dfad456f6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>domain.te</code></a>:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># Restrict PTYs to only allowed ioctls.</span><br><span class="line"># Note that granting this allowlist to domain does</span><br><span class="line"># not grant the wider ioctl permission.

So it seems it’s indeed the missing <code>TCSETSF</code> that caused this SELinux denial.</p><h2 id="Fixing-the-SELinux-policy"><a href="#Fixing-the-SELinux-policy" class="headerlink" title="Fixing the SELinux policy"></a>Fixing the SELinux policy</h2><p>Now that we have the root cause, can we fix it by simply adding <code>TCSETSF</code> to the macro <code>unpriv_tty_ioctls</code>, or was there any other concerns about it so that it was deliberately left out?</p><p>So I looked into git history of the file. Actually, the variant <code>TCSETSW</code> was the initial one added into <code>unpriv_tty_ioctls</code> in <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/306278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aosp/306278</a>, and the base <code>TCSETS</code> was added later by <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/310920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aosp/310920</a>. Looking at the initial change <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/306278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aosp/306278</a>, the primary reason to restrict ioctl for TTY devices was to mitigate the security exploit of <code>TIOCSTI</code>, so it indeed seems that adding <code>TCSETSF</code> as another variant of <code>TCSETS</code> and <code>TCSETSW</code> would be fine, and should fix all the code relying on it.</p><h2 id="Testing-and-submitting-the-fix"><a href="#Testing-and-submitting-the-fix" class="headerlink" title="Testing and submitting the fix"></a>Testing and submitting the fix</h2><p>Then I started testing my fix locally. As I’m working on Android already, I naturally starting tested on an eng build, however soon I was surprised to find that my sample app runs perfectly even without my fix. Was it somehow patched recently? However since I’ve been looking at the latest version of the source code anyway, was my entire theory going in the wrong direction? I became deeply confused, until I suddenly realized the special thing about eng build — <code>adb shell</code> has root access.</p><p>So I immediately checked the SELinux context of the shell with <code>ps -AZ | grep sh</code>, and the output was <code>u:r:su:s0</code>, so actually this wouldn’t be the usual SELinux context on consumer devices because the shell process can’t be in the <code>su</code> domain. The <code>su</code> domain has a lot of privileges, and no wonder my sample app was working fine inside it. I became relieved that I’m not dealing with something crazy, and began testing on a user build instead. This time the sample app failed without the fix, and worked when my fix was applied, so this is finally confirmed to be the correct fix. Yay!</p><p>The remaining work was uploading the patch as <a href="https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/1491378/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aosp/1491378</a>, getting it persubmit verified and code reviewed, and finally submitting the change. This concludes my small weekend journey into SELinux, and the <code>TCSAFLUSH</code> issue will become fixed with Android S release. However since there’s no way to backport the fix, we still have to stick with <code>TCSADRAIN</code> for Android 8.0–10 compatibility for some years.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ThinkPad T series (also X1 Carbon) laptops have a great keyboard that I’ve been using delightfully for years. However, there’s a minor issue with its keyboard layout: they replaced the <code>Menu</code> key with a <code>PrtSc</code>. In my day to day work, I almost always accidentally hit that key while using my lovely <code>Ctrl</code> and <code>Alt</code> keys, upon which my laptop happily plays a shatter sound, flashes my screen white for a split second and spawns a screenshot file under my <code>Pictures/</code> (thank you, GNOME). Whereas when I wanted to use my <code>Menu</code> key, it’s nowhere to be found.</p><p>However, there’s still an <code>Insert</code> key lying quietly in the top-right corner, which I never used (except for checking if some app even supports it). So why not make my old <code>Insert</code> <code>PrtSc</code> and my old <code>PrtSc</code> the new <code>Menu</code>?</p><p>Moreover, there are also 4 special keys (<code>Fn</code> + <code>F9</code>–<code>F12</code>) that could have been my media keys, but are by default strange things like <code>Settings</code> and <code>Search</code>. Why not map them to media keys as well?</p><img src="/remapping-thinkpad-keys-with-udev-hwdb/thinkpad-keyboard.webp" class=""title="ThinkPad keyboard (credit: Lenovo)"><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Things-I-tried"><a href="#Things-I-tried" class="headerlink" title="Things I tried"></a>Things I tried</h2><p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>xmodmap</code></a> was the go-to tool for remapping keys, and it works on the X11 server level so the only thing you need to care about is the X11 key symbols (no key codes, scan codes and other nightmares). However, naturally this tool won’t work under Wayland (which supports fractional scaling etc), and it cannot get automatically loaded by my GNOME 3 (even with autostart). Some say it’s been deprecated, and people should use <code>xkb</code> instead, so no luck here.</p><p>The other way is to modify the <code>xkb</code> key symbol database. Although it doesn’t provide any means of overriding in <code>/etc/</code>, you can directly edit the files under <code>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/</code>. The interesting files are <code>pc</code> for the standard keys, and <code>inet</code> for the special keys, and here’s the patch I’ve been using for two years:</p><figure class="highlight diff"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br><span class="line">27</span><br><span class="line">28</span><br><span class="line">29</span><br><span class="line">30</span><br><span class="line">31</span><br><span class="line">32</span><br><span class="line">33</span><br><span class="line">34</span><br><span class="line">35</span><br><span class="line">36</span><br><span class="line">37</span><br><span class="line">38</span><br><span class="line">39</span><br><span class="line">40</span><br><span class="line">41</span><br><span class="line">42</span><br><span class="line">43</span><br><span class="line">44</span><br><span class="line">45</span><br><span class="line">46</span><br><span class="line">47</span><br><span class="line">48</span><br><span class="line">49</span><br><span class="line">50</span><br><span class="line">51</span><br><span class="line">52</span><br><span class="line">53</span><br><span class="line">54</span><br><span class="line">55</span><br><span class="line">56</span><br><span class="line">57</span><br><span class="line">58</span><br><span class="line">59</span><br><span class="line">60</span><br><span class="line">61</span><br><span class="line">62</span><br><span class="line">63</span><br><span class="line">64</span><br><span class="line">65</span><br><span class="line">66</span><br><span class="line">67</span><br><span class="line">68</span><br><span class="line">69</span><br><span class="line">70</span><br><span class="line">71</span><br><span class="line">72</span><br><span class="line">73</span><br><span class="line">74</span><br><span class="line">75</span><br><span class="line">76</span><br><span class="line">77</span><br><span class="line">78</span><br><span class="line">79</span><br><span class="line">80</span><br><span class="line">81</span><br><span class="line">82</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">diff --git a/pc b/pc.zhnew</span><br><span class="line">index 0199713..33631cb 100644</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">--- a/pc</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">+++ b/pc.zhnew</span></span><br><span class="line">@@ -29,7 +29,7 @@ xkb_symbols "pc105" &#123;</span><br><span class="line">     key &lt;RTSH&gt;

The only problem with it, is that because these things live inside <code>/usr/</code>, which is managed by <code>pacman</code>, it is reverted to packaged version every time <code>xkeyboard-config</code> is updated, and it actually do get updated sometimes. In that case I’ll find me suddenly making screenshots again, and need to patch those files and reboot for things to work.</p><h2 id="Using-udev-hwdb"><a href="#Using-udev-hwdb" class="headerlink" title="Using udev hwdb"></a>Using udev hwdb</h2><p>Recently when I was doing some brief research about new ThinkPads, I came across the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T480#Special_buttons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArchWiki for ThinkPad T480</a>, which mentioned using something called hwdb to add support for its two special buttons. It looked promising, and I finally took some hours today to figure it out for my own remapping.</p><p>The hwdb in udev works on a much lower level: it maps the scan codes from your keyboard to standard key codes, and <code>/etc/udev/hwdb.d/</code> provides a means of customization, which allows overriding the way scan codes are mapped. Some more detail can be found out on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/map_scancodes_to_keycodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch Wiki</a>.</p><p>And here is the final hwdb file I came up with:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"># &#x2F;etc&#x2F;udev&#x2F;hwdb.d&#x2F;90-zh-thinkpad.hwdb</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">evdev:atkbd:dmi:bvn*:bvr*:bd*:svnLENOVO*:pn*:pvrThinkPad*</span><br><span class="line"> KEYBOARD_KEY_b7&#x3D;compose</span><br><span class="line"> KEYBOARD_KEY_d2&#x3D;sysrq</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">evdev:name:ThinkPad Extra Buttons:dmi:bvn*:bvr*:bd*:svnLENOVO*:pn*:pvrThinkPad*</span><br><span class="line"> KEYBOARD_KEY_1c&#x3D;playpause</span><br><span class="line"> KEYBOARD_KEY_1d&#x3D;stopcd</span><br><span class="line"> KEYBOARD_KEY_1e&#x3D;previoussong</span><br><span class="line"> KEYBOARD_KEY_1f&#x3D;nextsong</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The hwdb rules we need to write consists of two parts: matching and mapping. The matching expression is a shell glob that matches the device, where as the mapping maps the scan code (in hex) to key code macro names in kernel’s <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>include/uapi/linux/input-event-codes.h</code></a>. <code>man hwdb</code> provided some simple example, but actually comments in the <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/blob/master/hwdb/60-keyboard.hwdb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built-in hwdb file</a> provides much more details about this file.</p><p>In order to find out the scan codes for my keys, I tried both methods in <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_input#Identifying_scancodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch Wiki</a>. The traditional <code>showkey --scancodes</code> didn’t work well for me, requiring switching to a tty, and was printing multiple bytes of hex for a single keystroke of mine. In contrast, <code>evtest</code> was just the right tool. Just execute <code>sudo evtest</code> in a terminal and select something like <code>AT Translated Set 2 keyboard</code> for the builtin keyboard (mine is <code>3</code>), and you can test your keystrokes to find out its scan code in output like <code>(MSC_SCAN), value &lt;SCAN CODE HERE&gt;</code>.</p><img src="/remapping-thinkpad-keys-with-udev-hwdb/evtest-devices.png" class=""title="evtest listing devices"><img src="/remapping-thinkpad-keys-with-udev-hwdb/evtest-events.png" class=""title="evtest printing events"><p>Another caveat is that, for the special keys on ThinkPad keyboard, unlike regular keys they are not listed under the <code>AT Translated Set 2 keyboard</code>, but actually under another input device named <code>ThinkPad Extra Buttons</code>. It took me some time to realize this, and I also tried <code>showkey</code> which disappointed me again.</p><p>After we’ve got the scan codes from <code>evtest</code> and key codes from <code>input-event-codes.h</code>, it’s time to write the rule. We need the matching part for the two devices, whose format specification is available in the comment inside systemd’s bulitin hwdb file. The exact info for your current machine can be obtained from <code>cat /sys/class/dmi/id/modalias</code>, and combining with other existing ThinkPad rules in the builtin file I derived mine successfully.</p><p>The actual rules read by udev upon boot is a compiled binary file called <code>hwdb.bin</code>, so one will need to compile the configuration files into binary with <code>sudo systemd-hwdb update</code>. To make the changes take effect immediately, run <code>sudo udevadm trigger</code>, and finally, try out the new key mapping!</p><h2 id="One-last-thing…-the-Menu-key"><a href="#One-last-thing…-the-Menu-key" class="headerlink" title="One last thing… the Menu key"></a>One last thing… the Menu key</h2><p>Most of my key mapping worked, except for my new <code>Menu</code> key. I double checked the scan code and the key code name – they both seemed correct. In <code>input-event-codes.h</code>, I also found <code>KEY_OPITON</code> and <code>KEY_CONTEXT_MENU</code>, but neither of them worked as <code>Menu</code> key as well.</p><p>So I tried <code>xev</code>. Interestingly, it printed <code>XF86MenuKB</code> as the key symbol on the X11 level, instead of <code>Menu</code>. This must be something with the X11 key symbol database. I did some grep, played around for around half an hour, and finally found out the answer when I expanded my search into <code>/usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev</code>:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">alias &lt;MENU&gt; &#x3D; &lt;COMP&gt;;</span><br><span class="line">...</span><br><span class="line">&lt;I147&gt; &#x3D; 147;&#x2F;&#x2F; #define KEY_MENU                139</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Combined with the output from <code>xmodmap -pke | grep Menu</code>:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">keycode 135 &#x3D; Menu NoSymbol Menu</span><br><span class="line">keycode 147 &#x3D; XF86MenuKB NoSymbol XF86MenuKB</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>I surprisingly found out that my key code <code>KEY_MENU</code> was mapped to key symbol <code>XF86MenuKB</code>. And to map to key symbol <code>Menu</code>, I actually need to map my scan code to key code <code>KEY_COMP</code>.</p><p>So one last change, save, and <code>sudo systemd-hwdb update &amp;&amp; sudo udevadm trigger</code>. Hooray! All my keys are working flawlessly now, and I don’t need to worry about package updates anymore (just forget about <code>xkeyboard-config</code>). Although the obscure and scattered documentation put me through these tedious trial-and-error attempts, it still kinda excited me when I finally got my keys remapped correctly, after all these years.</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;ThinkPad T series (also X1 Carbon) laptops have a great keyboard that I’ve been using delightfully for years. However, there’s a minor issue with its keyboard layout: they replaced the &lt;code&gt;Menu&lt;/code&gt; key with a &lt;code&gt;PrtSc&lt;/code&gt;. In my day to day work, I almost always accidentally hit that key while using my lovely &lt;code&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Alt&lt;/code&gt; keys, upon which my laptop happily plays a shatter sound, flashes my screen white for a split second and spawns a screenshot file under my &lt;code&gt;Pictures/&lt;/code&gt; (thank you, GNOME). Whereas when I wanted to use my &lt;code&gt;Menu&lt;/code&gt; key, it’s nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there’s still an &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; key lying quietly in the top-right corner, which I never used (except for checking if some app even supports it). So why not make my old &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;PrtSc&lt;/code&gt; and my old &lt;code&gt;PrtSc&lt;/code&gt; the new &lt;code&gt;Menu&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are also 4 special keys (&lt;code&gt;Fn&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;F9&lt;/code&gt;–&lt;code&gt;F12&lt;/code&gt;) that could have been my media keys, but are by default strange things like &lt;code&gt;Settings&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Search&lt;/code&gt;. Why not map them to media keys as well?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Natural sort order is what we usually see in most file managers when browsing a list of numbered files, that it sorts the numerical part of the file name as a number instead of comparing it character by character. For instance:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lexicographical sort</th><th>Natural sort</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.txt</td><td>1.txt</td></tr><tr><td>10.txt</td><td>2.txt</td></tr><tr><td>100.txt</td><td>3.txt</td></tr><tr><td>101.txt</td><td>4.txt</td></tr><tr><td>102.txt</td><td>5.txt</td></tr><tr><td>103.txt</td><td>10.txt</td></tr><tr><td>104.txt</td><td>11.txt</td></tr><tr><td>105.txt</td><td>12.txt</td></tr><tr><td>11.txt</td><td>13.txt</td></tr><tr><td>12.txt</td><td>14.txt</td></tr><tr><td>13.txt</td><td>15.txt</td></tr><tr><td>14.txt</td><td>100.txt</td></tr><tr><td>15.txt</td><td>101.txt</td></tr><tr><td>2.txt</td><td>102.txt</td></tr><tr><td>3.txt</td><td>103.txt</td></tr><tr><td>4.txt</td><td>104.txt</td></tr><tr><td>5.txt</td><td>105.txt</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Lexicographical sort can be easily implemented using <code>String::compareToIgnoreCase</code>, but it is not very acceptable for end users. However for natural sort, things is actually a little more complicated.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="The-Definition"><a href="#The-Definition" class="headerlink" title="The Definition"></a>The Definition</h2><p>There is a small <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Natural_sort_order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia article on Natural Sort Order</a>, which mentioned the following definition for natural sort order:</p><blockquote><p>Natural sort order is an ordering of strings in alphabetical order, except that multi-digit numbers are ordered as a single character.</p></blockquote><p>However, there’s still some undefined behavior about this sort order when case-insensitivity is involved alongside treating numbers as a whole. In <a href="https://jjacky.com/2013-03-22-natural-sort-order-in-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article discussing natural sort order in C</a>, the author mentioned the following case:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Test1</td></tr><tr><td>tesT1</td></tr><tr><td>test1</td></tr><tr><td>tEst2</td></tr><tr><td>test2</td></tr><tr><td>test3</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These string is listed in a reasonable way, however if you simply define the natural sorting to be sorting chunks of characters and numbers individually, the <code>Test</code> string have to be equal to <code>test</code> so that the ordering won’t be deterministic.</p><p>And there’s another case involving leading zeros:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>test1</td></tr><tr><td>test01</td></tr><tr><td>test001</td></tr><tr><td>test01a</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Intuitively, things that are shorter should come before those longer ones, so equal numbers with less leading zeros should come before those with more. Furthermore, if there’s more text following the number, it should come after those without, thus the aforementioned leading zero comparison has a lower priority.</p><p>I didn’t find any standard for these corner cases, so I’m merely deciding on the most reasonable approach.</p><h2 id="Various-Implementations"><a href="#Various-Implementations" class="headerlink" title="Various Implementations"></a>Various Implementations</h2><p>There’s <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/sorting-for-humans-natural-sort-order/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article on CodingHorror</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1262239/natural-sort-order-string-comparison-in-java-is-one-built-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a StackOverflow question</a> that referenced some existing implementations.</p><p>And here are some additional implementations that I found inside some battlefield applications:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/eneim/cabinet/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/afollestad/cabinet/utils/AlphanumComparator.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cabinet/AlphanumComparator</a>: Adapted from DaveKoelle’s <code>AlphanumComparator</code>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/GNOME/glib/blob/master/glib/gunicollate.c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glib/g_utf8_collate_key_for_filename</a>: Used by Nautilus, generates a new string that can be used for comparison.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/coreutils/gnulib/blob/master/lib/filevercmp.c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gnulib/filevercmp</a>: Used by GNU coreutils’ <code>ls -v</code>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/sort.c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coreutils/sort</a>: Used by GNU coreutils’ <code>sort -V</code>.</li></ul><p>But there’s some common issues in existing implementations:</p><ul><li>Use of regular expression: The comparator is frequently evaluated during the sort, so performance is our concern and splitting on regular expressions is not what we expect under such conditions.</li><li>Memory allocation: Also due to the frequent invocation, we should avoid memory allocation (e.g. actually building those “chunks”), and this can be done by iteration over the two strings.</li><li>Unicode awareness: Unicode code points are not necessarily single <code>char</code>s (think of surrogates), so those code point related methods should be used instead of simple increment to advance the index of current “character”.</li><li>Locale awareness: Instead of <code>c &gt;= &#39;0&#39; &amp;&amp; c &lt;= &#39;9&#39;</code>, one should use <code>Character.isDigit()</code> and <code>Character.digit()</code> for getting numbers out of a character.</li><li>Correctness: Some implementations cannot handle the two aforementioned corner cases properly.</li><li>Coding style: Some implementations are simply not so readable.</li></ul><h2 id="My-Implementation"><a href="#My-Implementation" class="headerlink" title="My Implementation"></a>My Implementation</h2><p>So I wrote my own implementation with those issues in mind, and it basically iterates over the two string and handles consecutive digits together. Most of the code is self-explanatory and the comments can also describe the algorithm:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

      &lt;p&gt;Natural sort order is what we usually see in most file managers when browsing a list of numbered files, that it sorts the numerical part of the file name as a number instead of comparing it character by character. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Lexicographical sort&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Natural sort&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td&gt;10.txt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.txt&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;100.txt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3.txt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;101.txt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2.txt&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.txt&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5.txt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;105.txt&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexicographical sort can be easily implemented using &lt;code&gt;String::compareToIgnoreCase&lt;/code&gt;, but it is not very acceptable for end users. However for natural sort, things is actually a little more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/750/openweather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenWeather</a> has been my favorite GNOME extension for quick and beautiful weather information. However today when I looked at my top bar again for weather, I had the impression as if something is missing:</p><img src="/fixing-my-missing-degree-celsius-symbol/open-weather-without-degree-celsius.png" class=""title="Now"><p>And this is what it used to be like:</p><img src="/fixing-my-missing-degree-celsius-symbol/open-weather-with-degree-celsius.png" class=""title="Used to be"><p>My degree Celsius symbol is missing!</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Finding-the-culprit"><a href="#Finding-the-culprit" class="headerlink" title="Finding the culprit"></a>Finding the culprit</h2><p>The first thing I thought was, is this specific to OpenWeather? And I was surprised to find out that when I googled “degree Celsius symbol”, the <code>°C</code> as <code>U+00B0 ° degree sign</code> plus <code>U+0043 C latin capital letter c</code> is present, while ℃ as <code>U+2103 ℃ degree celsius</code> is simply empty. However a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with <code>font-family: serif</code> on Wikipedia showed the symbol correctly, so this must be a font/fontconfig issue.</p><p>And I <code>less</code>ed my own fontconfig configuration with <code>/etc/fonts/local.conf</code>:</p><figure class="highlight xml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

I googled a while for finding out the font selected by <code>fontconfig</code> for a glyph, and found <a href="https://repolinux.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/find-out-fallback-font-used-by-fontconfig-for-a-certain-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an article</a> suggesting the use of <code>FC_DEBUG</code> and <code>pango-view</code>:</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">FC_DEBUG=4 pango-view -q --font=<span class="string">'&lt;YOUR_FONT_FAMILY&gt;'</span> -t <span class="string">'&lt;YOUR_CHARACTER&gt;'</span> 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -o <span class="string">'family:"[^"]\+'</span> | cut -c 10- | tail -n 1</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The latter part basically filters out the last printed family name from the tedious debug output.

I’ve been using it for years, and now it’s giving me nothing for degree Celsius symbol? And why did fontconfig ever choose it seemed to have no such glyph?</p><p>Confused by this I opened my <code>wqy-microhei.ttc</code> with FontForge, and was again surprised to find out that my <code>WenQuanYi Micro Hei</code> is providing an empty glyph (instead of nothing) for certain codepoints!</p><img src="/fixing-my-missing-degree-celsius-symbol/font-forge-wqy-micro-hei.png" class=""title="Fontforge with highlight on empty glyphs"><p>This is crazy, and I’m left wondering how my degree Celsius symbol ever worked in the past few years.</p><h2 id="Finding-the-way-to-fix-it"><a href="#Finding-the-way-to-fix-it" class="headerlink" title="Finding the way to fix it"></a>Finding the way to fix it</h2><p>There must be some configuration that allow me to blacklist certain glyphs in a font.

Feeling excited, I scrolled down and found a single line of comment from the dev:</p><blockquote><p>This is fixed in master with target=scan charset editing.</p></blockquote><p>After all the hard work, why didn’t he or she celebrate the moment of closing this bug with a more detailed explanation, or at least a helpful pointer? Even after reading though <code>man fonts-conf</code>, I found nothing describing how I can edit the charset of a font family. After all, the <code>&lt;charset&gt;</code> element says it must contain one or more integer, however the whole charset normally contains a huge amount of hexadecimal integers.</p><p>So I searched harder and found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/47614324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another answer on StackOverflow</a>.

Their SourceForge issue tracker is also unattended for years with that <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/wqy/bugs/42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notorious hangul advance bug</a> still open. Sadly, the whole project seems dead. So I decided to work around instead of fixing this.</p><p>And one sentence I encountered during my search kept lingering in my mind:</p><p><em>When you gaze long into fontconfig, fontconfig also gazes into you.</em></p><p><strong>Update</strong>: With another link on their official website, I was able to find their real bug tracker and <a href="https://wenq.org/dev/index.cgi?MicroHei_Bug/0012" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this bug</a>, and <a href="https://wenq.org/dev/index.cgi?MicroHei_Bug/0013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a similar bug</a>. The dev said it’s fixed, but maybe some recent <code>fontconfig</code> or <code>freetype</code> changes brought it back. Maybe some day I should fork it and try to actually fix these bugs.</p><p>And according to the dev’s comment, those glyphs existed in <code>Droid Sans Fallback</code>, so a proper fix to my configuration should also include adding <code>Droid Sans Fallback</code> to the <code>sans-serif</code> and <code>monospace</code> families, right below the <code>WenQuanYi Micro Hei</code> entry.</p>]]></content>

&lt;p&gt;WebGL 拥有与 OpenGL ES 相似的 API（前者基于后者），但与 OpenGL 相比，两者缺少基础图形的渲染管线，而是需要手写 shader 进行渲染。&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言"><a href="# 前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言 </h2><p>Travis CI 是 GitHub 上开源项目采用持续集成的常见选择。为了给<a href="https://github.com/zhanghai/Douya" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 豆芽 </a> 提供持续集成版本用于公开测试，我配置了 Travis CI，并自己编写了脚本将构建结果发布到另一个空项目的 Release 中，并将其间的过程和遇到的问题记录于此。</p><p>Travis CI 构建 Android 项目的时间较长，因此调试配置时十分耗时。希望我的经验能对他人有所帮助。</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Travis-CI"><a href="#Travis-CI" class="headerlink" title="Travis CI"></a>Travis CI</h2><p>Travis CI 分为免费版（<a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travis-ci.org</a>）和付费版（<a href="https://travis-ci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travis-ci.com</a>），两者之间没有相互的链接或说明，第一次配置时容易混淆。开源项目选择免费版即可。配置过程可以参考官方的 <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Getting Started</a> 和 <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android 项目配置</a>。</p><p>关于 Android 项目有一些较为微妙的配置问题，我自己调试并查阅了一些 Issue 方才解决。</p><ol><li>为了能够找到并下载最新的 Build Tools，需要启用最新版本的 Tools（<code>- tools</code>）。</li><li>Lint 过程中如果 Platform Tools 版本低于 SDK 版本则会报错，需要启用最新版本的 Platform Tools（<code>-platform-tools</code>）。</li><li>为了能够找到并下载最新的 Platform Tools，需要已有最新的 Tools，因此与官方给出的样例不同，需要将 <code>- tools</code> 放置在 <code>- platform-tools</code> 之前。</li></ol><p>因此我的 Android 部分最终配置如下：</p><figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span

</h2><p>Gradle 是一个为缓存优化过的工具，因此官方也提供了相应的<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/android#Caching" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 开启缓存的方法</a>。</p><figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td

keystore 和密码。Travis CI 提供了 <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 在设置中定义环境变量 </a> 的方式来传递低敏感级的信息。</p><p>基于以上文档和一些搜索结果，并参考过 <a href="https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowsocks-Android 的配置方式</a>，我将我的签名配置编写为了从 <code>signing.properties</code>、环境变量、终端输入三个层级进行获取的方式。</p><p>以下是我的 <code>signing.gradle</code>：</p><figure class="highlight gradle"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>在 Android Studio 中进行 Gradle 同步时，<code>System.console()</code> 返回 <code>null</code>，因而密码均为 <code>null</code>，不会中断同步过程，也不影响调试版本的构建。</p><p>我创建了 <code>signing.properties</code> 和 <code>signing.properties.travis</code> 两个文件，在前者中填写 keystore 的路径并加入 <code>.gitignore</code>，而将后者在 <code>.travis.yml</code> 的 <code>before_script</code> 中复制为 <code>signing.properties</code>。</p><p>而在 Travis CI 的设置中，添加 <code>STORE_PASSWORD</code> 和 <code>KEY_PASSWORD</code> 两个环境变量即可。建议在环境变量值的两端加上单引号以避免特殊字符被 shell 错误处理。</p><h2 id="获取版本信息"><a href="# 获取版本信息" class="headerlink" title="获取版本信息"></a>获取版本信息 </h2><p> 直接在 <code>.travis.yml</code> 中调用 <code>git describe</code> 或 <code>git log</code> 等命令是无法成功的，因为 Travis CI 采用了 <code>git clone --depth=50</code> 来进行 clone。相应地，需要先执行 <code>git fetch --unshallow</code> 来完成 clone。</p><p>我采用了 <a href="http://semver.org/lang/zh-CN/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 语义化版本</a>（Semver）来命名版本。因此，我的版本名称采用了如下方式获取：</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">version=<span class="string">"<span class="variable">$(git describe --long --tags | sed's/^v//;s/-\([0-9]\+\)-g\([0-9a-f]\+\)/+\1.\2/')</span>"</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>例如，在名为 <code>1.0.0-alpha</code> 的 tag 后第 227 次短哈希值为 <code>886f8ce</code> 的 commit，对应的版本名即为 <code>1.0.0-alpha.1+227.886f8ce</code>。</p><p>然后使用 <code>sed -i &#39;s/versionName .*/versionName &quot;&#39;&quot;${version}&quot;&#39;&quot;/&#39; app/build.gradle</code> 即可更新 <code>build.gradle</code> 中的 <code>versionName</code> 字段。</p><h2 id="上传至 -Release"><a href="# 上传至 -Release" class="headerlink" title="上传至 Release"></a>上传至 Release</h2><p>GitHub 提供了在 Release 中上传二进制构建输出的功能。然而，如果直接在项目仓库中为每次 commit 添加 Release（和相应的 tag）则未免过于杂乱，因此我选择了新建 <a href="https://github.com/zhanghai/DouyaCiBuilds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 一个只有 README 的仓库</a>，并将所有持续集成版本的 Release 创建在此仓库中。</p><p>为了实现此功能，我选择了通过 curl 调用 GitHub API 的方式来完成。经过查阅文档和大量的调试，我的脚本最终是如下编写的：</p><figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span

&lt;p&gt;Travis CI 构建 Android 项目的时间较长，因此调试配置时十分耗时。希望我的经验能对他人有所帮助。&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言"><a href="# 前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言 </h2><p> 这篇文章是我在操作系统原理课程的作业。作业选题本身很宽，大意是只要描述操作系统的发展即可。因为早就对 Plan 9 这个旨在取代 Unix 的操作系统有兴趣，又可以借此花时间仔细理解和实际使用一次这个系统，于是毫不犹豫地选择了这个题目。</p><p>以下就是我自己对 Plan 9 这个操作系统在设计上的理解和概括。</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="简介"><a href="# 简介" class="headerlink" title="简介"></a>简介</h2><p>Plan 9 是一款分布式操作系统，由贝尔实验室计算机科学研究中心在 19 世纪 80 年代中期开始开发，旨在成为 Unix 的后继者。Plan 9 的团队正是曾开发 Unix 和 C 语言的团队，开发过程中参与者包括 Ken Thompson、Dennis Ritchie、Bjarne Stroustrup 等人。</p><p>本文将主要介绍 Plan 9 的部分设计理念。</p><h2 id="设计"><a href="# 设计" class="headerlink" title="设计"></a>设计 </h2><h3 id="文件"><a href="# 文件" class="headerlink" title="文件"></a> 文件 </h3><p>Plan 9 继承了 Unix 中“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 任何事物都是文件</a>”的哲学，并且对其进一步扩展，将所有计算资源都视为文件进行管理，使用读取和写入操作作为与资源交互的统一方式。</p><p>例如，在 Unix 中对许多具体硬件控制需要使用 <code>ioctl</code> 系统调用进行，以及 X Window 等系统中对于资源也使用函数调用控制而非用文件代表，但在 Plan 9 中，无论是 CPU、外围设备、网络，还是图形界面本身，设计者始终采用文件来代表资源并与之交互。</p><p>在这个意义下，其实文件的意义并非传统的磁盘存储的单元，而是一个指代一般意义上计算资源的名字。</p><h3 id="文件系统"><a href="# 文件系统" class="headerlink" title="文件系统"></a>文件系统</h3><p>Plan 9 与 Unix 同样采用的是层次性的文件系统。由于文件实际上就是资源，所以文件的路径实际上也与 URI 的意义类似，即计算资源可以通过特定的路径访问。</p><p>在文件的组织方式上，Plan 9 使用了与 Unix 类似约定的命名方式，例如也可以使用 <code>ls /proc</code> 查看所有进程等。</p><p>Plan 9 的文件系统并非传统意义上局限于磁盘的文件系统。在 Plan 9 中，由于资源即是文件，资源本身来自本地设备还是需要通过网络访问其实只是实现细节，所以两者在文件系统中具有统一的表示。Plan 9 采用一种名为 9P 的协议对资源的访问过程进行封装。经过这种抽象，系统中对远端和本机资源进行访问的接口达成了一致，由此通过分布式的文件系统从系统设计上实现了分布式计算的基础，例如即使是 CPU 资源也可以通过文件方便地共享。</p><h3 id="命名空间"><a href="# 命名空间" class="headerlink" title="命名空间"></a>命名空间 </h3><p> 文件系统只是资源的组织形式，而允许不同程序对资源采取不同的组织形式可以带来很大的可扩展性，因此 Plan 9 对每个进程使用使用了不同的文件系统，称为命名空间，并由此实现了资源的进程隔离。</p><p>此外，父进程还可以以 9P 协议向子进程的命名空间提供虚拟文件（以文件作为服务），这样实现了一种低成本而原生的跨进程资源访问，也使得提供给子进程资源可以被自由地替换。由此，实现 VPN 连接只需要将 <code>/net</code> 目录代理，实现窗口系统只需要将 <code>bitblt</code> 文件代理，等等。</p><h3 id="合并目录"><a href="# 合并目录" class="headerlink" title="合并目录"></a>合并目录 </h3><p> 因为要替换子进程文件系统中的目录，但目录中的内容又并非全部都需要重新提供，合并目录就成为了一个良好的解决方案。</p><p>Plan 9 中的合并目录是一种类似 Unix 中挂载和搜索路径相结合的做法。通过将目录甲合并至目录乙，访问目录乙时将会先在目录甲中进行查找，未找到时再在目录乙本身中查询。将这个设计与网络结合，则可以产生将远端的 <code>/bin</code> 目录合并至本地即可直接使用远端程序这样的使用方法。</p><h3 id="UTF-8"><a href="#UTF-8" class="headerlink" title="UTF-8"></a>UTF-8</h3><p>Plan 9 更加为人知晓的一个组件则是由 Ken Thompson 提出的 UTF-8 编码。通过这种编码方式，Unicode 自动兼容于原先的 ASCII 字符，不会出现需要编码转换的问题，因此时至今日已经被广泛采用。而 UTF-8 本身则早已是 Plan 9 的原生编码。</p><h2 id="发展"><a href="# 发展" class="headerlink" title="发展"></a>发展 </h2><p> 虽然 Plan 9 有着相对于 Unix 更加普适和可扩展的设计，但在实际使用中它并没有赢得太多的用户。</p><p>Plan 9 在 1992 年向大学公开，并在 1995 年由 AT&amp;T 商业发布。然而 1996 年，AT&amp;T 已将重心转移至 Inferno，一个基于 Plan 9 思想设计并且旨在与 Java 竞争的系统。到了 2000 年，掌管贝尔实验室的朗讯决定停止 Plan 9 的商业支持，并在几年之后将 Plan 9 的代码以自由软件许可的形式向大众公开。</p><h2 id="评价"><a href="# 评价" class="headerlink" title="评价"></a>评价</h2><p>Plan 9 对 Unix 中的许多理念做了进一步的提升和扩展，对资源管理和分布式计算进行了优秀而统一的实现，在操作系统架构的历史上具有不可磨灭的意义；来自其中的 UTF-8、rc shell 等组件，也被其他操作系统所吸纳接受；并且，Plan 9 的后继者 Inferno 和 Plan B 还在继续发展。</p><p>但是，仅有优雅的设计，却缺乏相应的生态，这导致了 Plan 9 在实际应用中的结果不成功，令人惋惜。这一切正如 Eric Raymond 所说，足以让目标高远的软件工程师们时时警醒：</p><blockquote><p>Plan 9 会失败，纯粹只是因为它的改进程度没有大到能取代 Unix。与 Plan 9 相比，Unix 虽然破破烂烂带有明显的缺陷，但还是能够把工作良好地完成，而这就足以保住它的地位了。</p><p>这件事情教给了那些怀有雄心壮志的系统架构师一个道理：一个更优解决方案所面临的最危险的敌人，其实是那些能把事情刚好完成的程序。</p></blockquote><h2 id="致谢"><a href="# 致谢" class="headerlink" title="致谢"></a>致谢 </h2><p> 本文写作过程中参考了 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan 9 from Bell Labs - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> 和 <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B2%9D%E7%88%BE%E5%AF%A6%E9%A9%97%E5%AE%A4%E4%B9%9D%E8%99%9F%E8%A8%88%E7%95%AB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">贝尔实验室九号计划 - 维基百科，自由的百科全书</a> 等页面的内容，在此表示感谢。</p>]]></content>

    <title>Thoughts on Content Handling in Android Application</title>

    <published>2015-10-05T04:44:12.000Z</published>
    <updated>2020-11-22T06:08:03.407Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>For content-oriented Android application, how and where to store the content to display is a issue every developer will be concerned with. The Android framework provided a comprehensive solution with <code>ContentProvider</code> (and a lot more) which suits quite well with a SQLite database; but in a lot of other scenarios, the app only need to have some information cached, while the majority of content is directly retrieved from network, thus eliminating the need for a database (and a complicated content scheme).</p><p>But when we look into the core of this issue, we will soon find out that it is in fact a problem of whether to have a central storage, and how to notify different components about a change.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Initial-Scenario"><a href="#Initial-Scenario" class="headerlink" title="Initial Scenario"></a>Initial Scenario</h2><p>Let’s look at the naive solution first, retrieving content from network and only keeping them in memory. In this case, no central storage is needed, and every component fetches its content independently, simple enough. But this approach immediately becomes flawed when it comes to content updating such as user modification. For instance, we have a list activity and a detail activity, and the user can often modified something in the detail activity, say, they clicked ‘like’, and the like button shall look activated not only in the detail activity, but also in the list activity now in background.</p><p>Content is fetched independently, so every component have no knowledge of whether someone else is holding the same content as itself, and that content will become stale when shown to user if the content this component newly retrieved is an updated version. Ideally speaking, any piece content is a single resource that should have only one state at point of time, and keeping it represented by one entity in memory is the best way to achieve this — yes, a central storage (whether in memory or also backed by disk), and the DRY (don’t repeat yourself) principle, a different story of the solution framework provided.</p><p>Anyway, we always need a notifying mechanism, instead of having some holder of a unique entity shared among clients, because clients may need to transform the content into something else instead of using the unique one directly, or they need notify others when content is changed.</p><h2 id="ContentProvider-Mechanism"><a href="#ContentProvider-Mechanism" class="headerlink" title="ContentProvider Mechanism"></a>ContentProvider Mechanism</h2><p>The idea behind <code>ContentProvider</code> is that, <code>ContentProvider</code> is the only central storage and all its content is the only real entity that will always be up-to-date, while the content its clients hold is only a copy that will easily get out-of-date. So when a change happened, the central storage is refreshed, and <code>ContentObserver</code>s are notified of the change and then they will query the central <code>ContentProvider</code> for an updated copy of content.</p><p>In this case, only the <code>ContentProvider</code> (or a delegated <code>SyncAdapter</code>) can fetch data from network; the clients can only request a fetch and wait for the change callback just as any other client. The central <code>ContentProvider</code> acts as a middle man between clients and network, to ensure the uniqueness of any content entity.</p><h2 id="Go-centralized"><a href="#Go-centralized" class="headerlink" title="Go centralized?"></a>Go centralized?</h2><p>But a principally-correct and comprehensive solution may not be the best solution for a specific type of scenario. We will face at least the following difficulties:</p><ol><li><p>Identifier: In order to ensure only one central entity per resource, We need URIs to uniquely identify resources just as its name suggests, so we must defining a content URI scheme. But things go complex quickly considering the complex logical hierarchy an interlinked content system will need.</p></li><li><p>Action: We’ll lose the flexibility on handling changes for special cases. Think of infinite loading, liking and post deleting, we’ll need a generic mechanism to notify all the observers on an URI if some items are newly loaded, modified or removed, while framework’s <code>ContentObserver</code> only offers an <code>onChanged()</code> method. However if we handle this only for specific cases, it can be much more easier to implement.</p></li><li><p>Releasing memory: Because most of the content is dynamic, there is little point in data persistence on disk. So we’ll store retrieved items only in memory, and then, we need to release them once nobody needs them. This can be tricky when, for instance, we have an observer on a collection, and another observer on a detail of this collection is removed, now whether the detailed content should be released depends on whether the collection observer actually observes on this detail, which cannot be inferred by the central content manager from URI scheme.</p></li><li><p>JSON interoperability: The framework <code>ContentProvider</code> mechanism uses <code>Cursor</code>, where only basic types and blob are valid column type, making it uninteroperable with the widely used JSON approach. We’ll have to roll our own.</p></li></ol><p>Implementing and using such a framework is a complex and heavy task, and complexity is error-prone, while it brings little advantage over the decentralized solution we are going to talk about.</p><h2 id="Stay-decentralized"><a href="#Stay-decentralized" class="headerlink" title="Stay decentralized"></a>Stay decentralized</h2><p>So we want to stay on the track of not having any central storage, and allow duplicated (so possibly inconsistent) entities of content in memory.</p><p>This way, we are to do a sync among components once we any content is newly fetched from network in this case. The solution is much more specific to each scenario in this case: we can utilize some already present event bus system to get notified of updates, listen to specific event code of content change, and then respond accordingly.</p><p>On the first sight, this solution may seem not generic enough, lacking in the beauty of unity. However, considering the overall cost of using a centralized storage with URI scheme, I believe this decentralized-and-syncing mechanism is the way to go for applications in this scenario.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Different mechanisms apply to different scenarios. Android’s centralized <code>ContentProvider</code> mechanism fits for content that should be persisted and synced, while the decentralized mechanism works well with application with highly-dynamic content.</p>]]></content>

The Android framework provided a comprehensive solution with &lt;code&gt;ContentProvider&lt;/code&gt; (and a lot more) which suits quite well with a SQLite database; but in a lot of other scenarios, the app only need to have some information cached, while the majority of content is directly retrieved from network, thus eliminating the need for a database (and a complicated content scheme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we look into the core of this issue, we will soon find out that it is in fact a problem of whether to have a central storage, and how to notify different components about a change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言"><a href="# 前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言 </h2><p> 从我入门 Android 开发至今已经两年有余，过程中有了一些经验和积累，所以在此将我对于入门者的建议记录下来。</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Java"><a href="#Java" class="headerlink" title="Java"></a>Java</h2><p>学习 Android 开发，首先要有扎实的 Java 基础。如果不理解一门语言的设计思想，编写代码时将常常感觉思维与语法发生冲突，同时也无法针对这门语言扬长避短，最终代码将会难以实现和维护。</p><p>对于尚无 Java 基础的同学，我推荐 <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1474824/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">《Thinking in Java》</a> 这本书（中文译本为<a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/2130190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">《Java 编程思想》</a>），因为它对 Java 语法和设计的讲解较为精确详细，同时对设计模式和最佳实践也有合适的涉猎。这本书除了最后一章关于图形界面的部分可以跳过，之前所有的章节，都应当仔细地阅读和理解一遍。我个人在阅读时使用了两周大约 40 小时的时间。</p><p>此外，初学者请格外重视代码风格，始终遵循 Java 的编码规范，因为这可以使代码风格统一、结构有序、逻辑清晰和易于维护。IntelliJ Idea（Android Studio）的默认代码风格正与之符合。</p><h2 id="框架入门"><a href="# 框架入门" class="headerlink" title="框架入门"></a>框架入门 </h2><p> 在拥有了 Java 语法基础之后，就可以开始学习 Android 的框架了。</p><p>Android API 和最佳实践的更新较为迅速，所以几乎没有可靠的 Android 开发书籍，不推荐购买书籍入门。而 <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android 官方网站的文档</a> 是保持与框架同步的，同时也有很多关于最佳实践的介绍。</p><p>所以我的建议是，从官方文档的 <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Training</a> 开始，读完最基础的部分后，自己想好要做的一个小型项目，再按照需求查找 <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guide</a> 和 <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/packages.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reference</a>，结合 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow</a> 等资源，在实践中完成第一个自己的 Android 应用，掌握一些 Android 开发的基础知识。这个过程我使用了另外两周的时间。</p><p>此外作为补充，<a href="http://guides.codepath.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code Path 的教程</a> 也可以参考，虽然并非必须；大多数最佳实践和陷阱都需要开发者自己通过搜索多方资料和阅读源代码积累。</p><h2 id="开发环境"><a href="# 开发环境" class="headerlink" title="开发环境"></a>开发环境 </h2><p> 关于开发时使用的环境，Eclipse 早已经是日薄西山，而构建于 <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IntelliJ Idea</a> 之上的 <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Studio</a> 才是 Google 和社区支持的重心，也是在官方文档中建议使用的开发环境。</p><p>同时，Android Studio 的 Refactor，Generate，Lint Check 等功能也十分强大，能够显著地提高开发体验和效率。此外 Emacs 键绑定在调节个别设置之后就完全可用。</p><p>Android Studio 的连击 Shift 全局搜索功能在想要打开特定文件时也十分好用，默认在工程范围内搜索，再次连击可以将框架代码也纳入搜索范围。</p><p>在工具的选择上还是应该以功能性和主流选择为依据，因此我建议即使之前熟悉 Eclipse 的同学，也开始使用 Android Studio 进行 Android 开发。</p><p>官方文档中有关于 Android Studio 和 Android SDK 配置的详细说明。Android Studio 的更新动态可以在 <a href="http://tools.android.com/recent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anroid Tools Project Site</a> 上查看，也提供了 RSS 订阅。</p><h2 id="问题解决"><a href="# 问题解决" class="headerlink" title="问题解决"></a>问题解决 </h2><p> 在开发的过程中如果遇到问题，首先可以尝试 <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google 搜索</a>。搜索结果中，又以 Android 官方的教程结果为好，<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StackOverflow</a> 辅之，某些编写精良的国外博客可以参考。</p><p>此外，如果是框架或者支持库的 Bug，<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Code Issues</a> 和 StackOverflow 上也可能有人贴出 Workaround；如果暂时没有，自己在 Google Code 上提交 issue 也有一定可能收到关注<del>（和 Chris Banes 搭话玩）</del>。</p><p>对于 CSDN、博客园等国内博客，则应该尽量避免，即使读时，应抱有将信将疑的态度，因为国内博客的总体质量偏低，常常代码风格混乱、不遵循最佳实践、只以达成效果为目的，甚至可能有明显的错误。当然少数排版良好、编写细致的博客除外。</p><p>至于 Android 开发 QQ 群、微信群等，由于质量和氛围，在总体上个人极其不建议新手加入。</p><h1 id="阅读框架代码"><a href="# 阅读框架代码" class="headerlink" title="阅读框架代码"></a>阅读框架代码 </h1><p> 如果问题没有直接的解答，则可以尝试查看 Android 的 JavaDoc 和源代码，来理解框架的具体行为。</p><p>在这个过程中，Android Studio 是很好的工具。通过按住 Ctrl + 单击，可以跳转到源代码所在的位置，或者资源文件的定义；点击类或方法左侧行号旁边的标记，可以访问继承或重载当前片段的代码，查看框架的细节行为，或是内部的使用范例；这些功能使得查看框架代码十分方便快捷。</p><p>此外，<a href="http://grepcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GrepCode</a>、<a href="https://github.com/android/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> 和 <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Source</a> 可以在线查看框架代码的变更，以及未进入 SDK 的代码，使用时 Google“类名 网站名”即可。三家各有千秋。GrepCode 类名或方法名旁的向下箭头，类似 Android Studio，可以点击查看使用情况或者继承、覆盖者等，便于快速定位问题、理解架构；GitHub 和 Google Source 则有完整的 git 记录，可以查看 diff 和 blame（GoogleSource 是真正的版本库所在地，GitHub 会自动拉取 GoogleSource 上的更新）；个人感觉 GitHub 的界面和功能相对更加友好一些。</p><p>顺带一提，涉及到 IPC 的 <code>IBinder</code> 之类代码，具体实现可以在 <code>com.android.server</code> 这个包下找到。</p><h2 id="向下兼容"><a href="# 向下兼容" class="headerlink" title="向下兼容"></a>向下兼容 </h2><p> 虽然 Android 的 Training 和 Guide 中大部分是以原生框架 API 来教学的，但实际上有一些功能是在后续版本的 Android 中才引入的，直接使用这些功能会导致在旧的 Android 上找不到相应方法而发生崩溃。</p><p>在 Android 开发的早期，问题不是如此明显，开发者经常自己条件执行与版本相关的代码。久而久之，也有人将部分方面的兼容性代码封装成库提供给开发者使用，直到后来 Android 官方终于发布了 <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Support Library</a> 来全面地完成这项工作。</p><p>我曾经对支持库有所保留，有时还是偏向于使用原生实现而非支持库实现。但后来我慢慢感受到，Android 官方的支持重点还是使用支持库的方式，并且这样也能够不断带来更好的兼容性。因此，我还是建议新手在使用新 API 时，选择支持库而非原生实现。</p><p>目前支持库主要向下支持至 V7，而官方建议开发者向下支持至 V14（Android 4.0） 就可以了，这样覆盖了 95% 左右的用户。关于 Android 版本的统计数据可以在 <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">这里</a> 查看。</p><h2 id="开源第三方库"><a href="# 开源第三方库" class="headerlink" title="开源第三方库"></a>开源第三方库</h2><p>Android 中界面、网络、数据存储等许多高级功能的实现可能较为复杂，这时开源库就变得十分方便。现在大多数 Android 的开源库都托管在 GitHub 上，并支持在 gradle 中一行引入。但是，GitHub 并非专注于 Android，搜索功能也还有待提升，因此以下介绍其他一些常用的技巧。</p><p>建议：</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a>：直接搜索你的关键字即可。</li><li><a href="https://android-arsenal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Arsenal</a>：目前最好用的 Android 开源库索引，提供搜索和分类查询。</li></ul><p>了解：</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Trinea/android-open-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Open Project</a>：收录 Android 开源库的 Repo，较全，但不如以上方法。</li><li><a href="https://github.com/wasabeef/awesome-android-ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome Android UI</a>：内容同上，一般全。</li><li><a href="https://github.com/snowdream/awesome-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Awesome Android</a>：同上，一般全。</li></ul><p>在选择开源库时，建议考察它的 Star/Fork 数、文档、代码风格、作者回复 Issue 的活跃程度，谨慎作出决定。一旦使用，建议 Watch 此项目，关注更新。</p><p>建议使用的部分开源第三方库：</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ButterKnife</a>：自动视图注入，替代冗长的 <code>findViewById()</code>。</li><li><a href="https://github.com/mcxiaoke/android-volley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volley</a>：短时网络请求。已进入 AOSP，链接中是第三方附加了一些 Tweak 的镜像。</li><li><a href="https://github.com/google/gson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gson</a>：JSON 与 Java 对象自动转换，在进行数据模型复杂的应用开发时极其有用，与 Volley 搭配和谐。</li><li><a href="https://github.com/bumptech/glide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glide</a>：为可回收视图容器优化的图片加载，可与 Volley 整合。被 Chris Banes 在 <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheesesquare</a> 中使用。</li><li><a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThreetenABP</a>：Java 8 日期时间 API，优异的设计和实现，从此日期时间编程不再困难。</li></ul><p>另外提一下其他几个项目，且并非针对作者个人。在我个人看来，虽然很多很全，但 <a href="https://github.com/Trinea/android-common" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android-common</a> 和 <a href="https://github.com/Trinea/android-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">android-demo</a> 两个项目的代码质量并不算很高，也无法确定是否始终遵循着 Android 最新的变更和最佳实践。因此，我个人极其反对直接复制粘贴其中的代码（或者其他任何代码），也不推荐直接参考其中的代码而不查阅其他来源；相应地，应该始终使用 Google 搜索解决方案，这样才能保持最新。</p><h2 id="界面设计"><a href="# 界面设计" class="headerlink" title="界面设计"></a>界面设计 </h2><p> 作为一名合格的 Android 开发者，也应该拥有 Android 相关的设计素养，而不是设计师给了一个不标准（或者像 iOS）的设计，却不知道提出意见或修正。</p><p>Android 现有的设计规范是 <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material Design</a>，已经初步成熟，但有时还是会有小的补充，因此建议始终阅读这个文档。在入门 Android 开发后，建议抽出时间，将这份文档通读一遍，以了解符合 Android 平台的设计。另外，我见过的几个中文版设计文档翻译质量一般，排版较差，还有一些时效性问题，因此不是十分建议阅读。</p><p>Material Design 的实现主要依靠支持库中的 AppCompat 和 Design 库，目前文档不算十分完善，可以参考 <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.jp/2015/05/android-design-support-library.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlogSpot 上的相关介绍</a> 和 <a href="https://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Banes 的 CheeseSquare</a>，辅助以 StackOverflow、Google Code Issues 和部分国外博客。</p><p>为了精确地实现界面布局，可以使用开发者选项中的“显示视图边界”来确定各个视图的大小和位置，此外 <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faizmalkani.keylines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KeylinePushing</a> 是一款十分好用的工具应用，可以在屏幕上显示关键线和网格，帮助检视视图布局。</p><p>关于设计资源。<a href="https://www.google.com/design/icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material Icons</a> 是 Google 的开源 Material Design 图标库，内容十分丰富，也符合设计规范。<a href="http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android Asset Studio</a> 曾经十分流行，但由于 Material Design 的引入开始有些过时，不过启动器图标和设备预览图的生成器依然可以使用。</p><h2 id="信息来源"><a href="# 信息来源" class="headerlink" title="信息来源"></a>信息来源</h2><p>Android 的更新发展较为快速，为了跟进 Android 最新的动态，可以了解、关注或订阅以下的人或内容。其中，Google Plus 可以作为一个干净的技术社交平台（屏蔽几个热门推荐就好），有很多活跃的 Android 开发者和社群，十分建议加入。</p><p>建议：</p><ul><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/+AndroidDevelopers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">+Android Developers</a>：Android 官方帐号，新闻、ProTip、工具更新等，十分值得关注。</li><li><a

id="结语"><a href="# 结语" class="headerlink" title="结语"></a>结语 </h2><p> 学习和开发是一个循序渐进的过程，通过一个实际项目，不断接触 Android 的方方面面，例如网络、数据库、视图、资源系统、组件、支持库等等，最终才可以对 Android 开发拥有深入的了解。祝各位学习顺利。</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言"><a href="# 前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言 </h2><p> 在我的计算机组成课程上，教授要求编写一个 MIPS 汇编器并提供图形界面。由于我的工作环境并非 Windows，同时希望在各个平台的界面中使用原生控件，并且我偏好使用静态类型语言，所以决定使用 SWT 进行图形界面的编写。</p><img src="/building-portable-desktop-application-with-swt/mipsasm-windows.png" class=""title="MIPS 汇编集成开发环境 - Windows"><a id="more"></a><img src="/building-portable-desktop-application-with-swt/mipsasm-gtk3.png" class=""title="MIPS 汇编集成开发环境 - GTK+ 3"><h2 id="集成"><a href="# 集成" class="headerlink" title="集成"></a>集成 </h2><p> 鉴于 Maven 上的版本老旧，推荐直接前往 <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWT 官方网站 </a> 下载稳定发行版本。我使用的开发环境是 IntelliJ Idea，因此在 Project Structure 中的 Libraries 和 Artifacts 内添加相应的设置即可。</p><h2 id="架构"><a href="# 架构" class="headerlink" title="架构"></a>架构 </h2><p> 我是一名 Android 开发者，因此我在学习 SWT 时也会与 Android 框架进行对比。二者多有类似，也有不同。</p><p>在 SWT 中，<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Display</code></a> 与 Android 中 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Context</code></a> 和 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Application</code></a> 的设计有所相近，具有系统资源管理和应用层面操作的功能。而 <code>Display</code> 的一个实用的扩展是 <code>Display.getCurrent()</code> 和 <code>Display.getDefault()</code>，即可以通过静态方法获取当前线程或默认的 <code>Display</code>。</p><p>而与 Android 中的 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Activity</code></a> 相近的则是 <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Shell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Shell</code></a>。<code>Shell</code> 代表一个平台无关的抽象窗口，由此可以进行窗口相关的操作，并建立视图结构。</p><p>与 Andorid 不同，SWT 中没有 XML 布局系统，所有视图的创建需要由应用程序的 Java 代码完成（但有自动将 XML 转换为 Java 代码的工具，如 <a href="https://code.google.com/p/swtxml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SWTXML</a> 等）。<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Control.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Control</code></a> 与 Android 中的 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>View</code></a> 类似，是所有控件的基类，但不同的是，所有的 <code>Control</code> 在构造时都需要一个 <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Composite.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Composite</code></a> 作为父对象，既是 Android 中的 <code>Context</code>，也是视图结构上的父容器。而之后如果需要更改控件的父容器，可以调用<code>Control.setParent()</code>，但是否成功则需要由平台支持决定。</p><p>一个窗口最初的 <code>Composite</code> 实例即是 <code>Shell</code>。</p><h2 id="使用"><a href="# 使用" class="headerlink" title="使用"></a>使用 </h2><h3 id="主循环"><a href="# 主循环" class="headerlink" title="主循环"></a> 主循环</h3><p>SWT 的主循环是由应用程序自己书写的。常见的范式如下：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span

title="视图布局"></a>视图布局</h3><p>SWT 中的布局方式分为两步：使用 <code>Composite.setLayout()</code> 设置父元素布局子元素时使用的布局方式，使用 <code>Control.setLayoutData()</code> 提供子元素的布局参数。这与 Android 中的布局方式有些许不同，即 SWT 中的 <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Layout</code></a> 是父容器的参数而非父容器本身的类型。</p><p>SWT 中常用的 <code>Layout</code> 包括 <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/FillLayout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>FillLayout</code></a>、<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/RowLayout.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>RowLayout</code></a>、<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/layout/GridLayout.html" target="_blank"

rel="noopener"><code>FormLayout</code></a> 和 <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/custom/SashForm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SashForm</code></a> 等。对于前三种基础布局，可以参考 <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-Understanding-Layouts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eclipse 的这篇文章 </a> 进行学习。</p><h3 id="资源系统"><a href="# 资源系统" class="headerlink" title="资源系统"></a>资源系统 </h3><p> 与 Android 框架不同，SWT 只是一个图形界面库，因此不提供资源系统。</p><p>在写作一般规模的 SWT 应用时，可以使用 Java 自带的 <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ResourceBundle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ResourceBundle</code></a> 进行资源管理与国际化。</p><p>常见的范式如下：</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ResourceBundle resourceBundle =

class="line">Display.setAppName(resourceBundle.getString(<span class="string">"app_name"</span>));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>其中 <code>Utf8Control</code> 是为了使得 ResourceBundle 支持直接读取 UTF-8 编码的资源文件的类，可以从之后我的项目中获得我编写的版本；ResourceBundle 默认只支持 ASCII 编码。</p><h3 id="设置存储"><a href="# 设置存储" class="headerlink" title="设置存储"></a>设置存储 </h3><p> 为了保存用户的设置，可以使用 Java 自带的 <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/prefs/Preferences.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Preferences</code></a> 进行键值对的存储。使用时可以通过 <code>Preferences.userNodeForPackage()</code> 获取一个节点的 <code>Preferences</code> 实例，而之后则与使用 Android 中的 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SharedPreferences</code></a> 类似。</p><h2 id="部署"><a href="# 部署" class="headerlink" title="部署"></a>部署 </h2><p> 在 Linux 上，一个 Shell 脚本执行 <code>java -jar</code> 已经足够。</p><p>在 Windows 上，经过一些比较，我决定使用 <a href="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch4j</a>，至今体验良好。</p><p>在 Mac OS X 上，JVM 需要特定参数才能正常启动应用，以及其他打包应用程序的细节，可以参考 <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/swt/macosx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 这篇 Eclipse 的文档</a>。</p><h2 id="评价"><a href="# 评价" class="headerlink" title="评价"></a>评价 </h2><p> 在使用 SWT 完成我的项目后，总体来说，感觉这是一个可用的图形库。</p><p>从接口方面看，SWT 遵循着一致的命名规范，但 Builder 模式的缺失使得构造控件的过程较为冗长，此外将样式、键码等大量常量放置在 <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/luna/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/SWT.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>SWT</code></a> 类中也显得较为奇怪。</p><p>从功能方面看，SWT 跨平台调用原生控件的能力确实令人惊喜。众多部件在 Windows、Linux GTK+ 3 和 GTK+ 2、Mac OS X Cocoa 上不需要经过调试即表现良好，并且通过打包与原生应用几乎没有什么差异。美中不足的只是一些小的设计细节，例如标签中的文本不能使用光标选择复制、带有链接的多行标签需要使用另一个类却不能指定多行文本居中对齐。但总体来说，这些瑕疵要么可以绕过，要么相比于 SWT

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="前言"><a href="# 前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言 </h2><p>Android 中<code>ListView</code> 的拖放操作和动画实现已经被 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BZIvjMgH-Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 这个 DevByte</a> 和 <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/devbytes/animation/ListViewDraggingAnimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 相关的样例 </a> 说明，并且也有 <a href="https://github.com/nhaarman/ListViewAnimations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ListViewAnimations</a> 这样强大的开源库进行了集成。但是，一番 Google 后，我发现基于 <code>LinearLayout</code> 的相关实现却不多。</p><p>然而，有时我们可能需要使用 <code>LinearLayout</code> 替代 <code>ListView</code> 来实现列表，例如不需要 <code>ListView</code> 的视图回收机制（比如使用 <code>Fragment</code> 作为列表项），或者我们需要把这个视图放在 <code>ScrollView</code> 中。</p><p>在使用 <code>LinearLayout</code> 实现拖放和动画时，实现代码相比于之前提到的 <code>ListView</code> 实现也需要一些变动。因为我在网络上没有找到相应的资料，所以写下这篇文章来记录这个过程。</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="拖放"><a href="# 拖放" class="headerlink" title="拖放"></a>拖放 </h2><blockquote class="callout"><div class="title"> 前置阅读</div><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/drag-drop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drag and Drop | Android Developers</a><br></blockquote><p>为 <code>LinearLayout</code> 设定 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.OnDragListener.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>View.OnDragListener</code></a> 很简单，其机制在官方教程中有详细说明，在此不再赘述。</p><p>但是，官方教程中给出的样例在释放被拖动条目后只会显示一条 <code>Toast</code>，而一般的需求则是拖放排序。所以在参考了网上的一些文章后，我给出了下面这个简单的实现。与官方样例相比，添加的主要是在<code>ViewGroup</code> 中交换子视图的实现，以及将被拖动的视图作为 <code>LocalState</code> 传递。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td

title="在拖动过程中响应更改"></a>在拖动过程中响应更改 </h2><p> 言归正传。为了实现拖放过程中的动画，我们的目标是使用 <code>LinearLayout</code> 的列表视图能够对用户的拖动实时作出相应，也就是每次当用户的拖动越过某个临界线的时候，就将列表展现为被拖动条目在这里放下时的预览。因此，需要完成的工作就是将被拖动视图的 <code>Visibility</code> 设置为<code>View.INVISIBLE</code>，此时被拖动视图参与布局计算，但不进行绘制（已经被用户拖起），再不断改变列表中各个条目的位置。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

可能来不及向每个经过的视图发送消息，这种方式可能导致列表顺序的改变的问题（我在自己测试时就遇到了）。</p><p>所以在实现视图交换时，我们需要使用递归的方式进行，直到两个视图达到相邻。实现代码如下。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

target="_blank" rel="noopener">justasm 的 DragLinearLayout</a> 中的代码，在此表示感谢。</p><blockquote class="callout"><div class="title">前置阅读</div><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/prop-animation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Property Animation | Android Developers</a></blockquote><p>在实现动画时，我们主要利用的是 Android 的属性动画机制，涉及到的是 <code>View</code> 的<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Y</code></a>这个属性。</p><p>在谈及实际实现之前，值得在此提及的是 <code>View</code> 的<code>Left</code>和 <code>Top</code> 与<code>X</code>和 <code>Y</code> 的关系。<code>Left</code>和 <code>Top</code> 是在视图树布局过程中按照视图层级和布局参数等得出的，表示特定视图在屏幕上被布局系统分配的位置；而 <code>X</code> 和<code>Y</code>则是用于在实际绘制视图时定位的依据。</p><p>这种实现的好处是，通过将实际绘制时与布局时的视图位置独立起来，可以实现动画过程中视图的位移、旋转等视觉变换，而不必受到布局系统中视图定位的拘束。顺带一提，<code>X</code>和 <code>Y</code> 其实是由 <code>Left</code> 和<code>Top</code>分别加上 <code>TRANSLATION_X</code> 和<code>TRANSLATION_Y</code>得到的，这是因为实际上视图还是要依赖于布局才能定位。</p><p>言归正传。为了让视图位置的变化更加平滑，需要让视图的绘制位置从上一个位置渐变到下一个位置。我们在需要改变视图位置时可以通过 <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#getY%28%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>View.getY()</code></a> 得到视图当前的绘制位置，但视图的下一个位置则需要经过下一次布局计算后才能获得。因此，我们使用一个常见的技巧，也就是利用<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ViewTreeObserver.OnPreDrawListener</code></a>，在绘制之前获取已经计算完成的布局位置，在这时开始进行视图动画。</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span

&lt;p&gt;然而，有时我们可能需要使用&lt;code&gt;LinearLayout&lt;/code&gt;替代&lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;来实现列表，例如不需要&lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;的视图回收机制（比如使用&lt;code&gt;Fragment&lt;/code&gt;作为列表项），或者我们需要把这个视图放在&lt;code&gt;ScrollView&lt;/code&gt;中。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;在使用&lt;code&gt;LinearLayout&lt;/code&gt;实现拖放和动画时，实现代码相比于之前提到的&lt;code&gt;ListView&lt;/code&gt;实现也需要一些变动。因为我在网络上没有找到相应的资料，所以写下这篇文章来记录这个过程。&lt;/p&gt;
